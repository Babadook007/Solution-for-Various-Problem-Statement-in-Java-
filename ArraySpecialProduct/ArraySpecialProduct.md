### Array Special Product

------

Implement a function which, given an array of integers, returns a new array for which every index carries the value of the product of the remaining elements.

Example

Given array [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] it would return [120, 40, 60,30, 24]

Given array [4, 10, 3] it would return [30, 12, 40]

Function Description

The function findSpecialProduct accepts the following parameters

- An array of integers "input" of size n.

The function must return a new array of size n in which every index carries the value of the product of the remaining elements.
